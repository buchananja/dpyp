#### About:
- This is a cursory attempt at building a data manipulation library in Python.
- I use this package daily when assembling and maintaining pipelines, and 
analysing data.

#### Aims:
- Build common data manipulation procedures with clear syntax for pipelines.
- Build robust testing and error handling with high coverage.
- Allow customisation within functions for flexibility and ease of use.
- Maintain a cohesive naming scheme, syntax, and styling.
