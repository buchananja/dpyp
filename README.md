## About
- dpypr is a convenience wrapper for Pandas that aids the use of 'data 
dictionaries' in small-scale data pipelines.

## Use
- dpypr allows users to gather target files from directories into data dictionaries.
- Users can then apply cleaning and transformation functions iteratively to dictionaries, making batch processing quick to write and highly readable.
