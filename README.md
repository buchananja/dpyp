#### Notes:
- This is a cursory attempt to build a module containing my frequently used functions in my data pipelines.
- I use the following code regularly for my own convenience in cleaning and transofrming tabular data.
- This module is a work in progress with additional functionality built as required.

#### Aims:
- Build common data manipulation procedures as functions with clear syntax (e.g. select & rename columns, groupby & aggregate, format headers, replace nulls with zeros, etc.).
