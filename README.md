#### About:
- This is a cursory attempt at building a data manipulation library in Python.
- I use this package daily when assembling and maintaining pipelines and 
analysing data.

#### Aims:
- Build common data manipulation procedures with clear syntax.
- Build robust testing and error handling.
- Allow customisation within functions for flexibility and ease of use.
