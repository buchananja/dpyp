## About
- dpypr is a data-manipulation library aimed at manipulating data dictionaries in Python for use in small-scale data pipelines.
- Currenlty, Pandas is heavily utilised for reading, writing, and cleaning operations.
- I use this package daily when assembling and maintaining small-scale data pipelines.

## Use
- dpypr allows users to gather target files from directories into data 
dictionaries (e.g. all .csv, .xlsx, .parquet, etc.).
- Users can then apply cleaning and transformation funcions that are iteratively applied to all data in the dictionary, making batch processingquick to write and more readable.
